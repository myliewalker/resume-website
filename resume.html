            <h3>Huffman Coding Project</h3>
            <p>Developed a compression/decompression algorithm that optimizes storage by compressing each character 
                in a text file based on the frequency with which it occurs</p>
            
            <h3>Autocomplete Project</h3>

            <h3>Gruss Lipper Biophotonics Lab</h3>
            <p>Research Intern</p>
            <p>June 2017 - August 2017</p>
            <p>I developed and tested a near-infrared biosensor. This biosensor detects the activity of RhoA, a protein 
                whose functionality is important for many different types of cancer. Unlike previous biosensors, it uses 
                near-infrared proteins and therefore allows for the visualization of tumors and cells in living organisms. 
                After I designed a preliminary biosensor, I tested its efficiency by measuring the proteins' light emissions. 
                These results showed that although it transferred light efficiently, the proteins were not as abundant as 
                they should have been. In order to improve the biosensor's functionality, my mentor and I decided to change 
                its structure to mimic that of a different near-infrared biosensor. This second version was significantly 
                better - the protein levels were higher, and the efficiency was nearly comparable to both the original 
                version, and current RhoA biosensors. Based on these results, my mentor is working to combine the aspects of 
                both these devices and develop an optimized version.</p>
            
            <h3>Casanova Lab</h3>
            <p>Research Intern</p>
            <p>June 2016 - August 2016</p>
            <p>This lab studies genetic susceptibility to acquiring infectious diseases. I genetically analyzed DNA samples 
                in order to experimentally determine whether individuals were genetically susceptible to acquire tuberculosis. 
                In order to do this, I used standard lab procedures such as polymerase chain reactions (PCR) and chemical cut 
                using enzymes to amplify the DNA and focus on a specific part of the sequence. Once I obtained the desired 
                components, I ran the product through software that analyzed the sample extracted the DNA sequence. After 
                reading this sequence, I identified the genotype of each individual and determined whether each individual was 
                genetically susceptible to TB. Using these results, the lab studying the DNA of the susceptible individuals in 
                order to identify the genetic mutation and locate the TB-causing mutant.</p>
            
            <h3>Innocence Project</h3>
            <p>Summer Intern</p>
            <p>June 2015 - July 2015</p>
            <p>The Innocence Project is a nonprofit organization that works to exonerate the wrongfully convicted. I helped 
                organize information regarding eyewitness identification and defendants' confessions. Both of these pieces of 
                evidence are very compelling to juries, and are typically integral parts of proving a defendant guilty. However, 
                the organization is working to examine cases in which these fail, because either witnesses misidentify the guilty 
                party or defendants falsely confess. I helped organize the office's library system and added additional articles 
                that discuss the issues of eyewitness misidentification give false confessions. I also identified eyewitness 
                identification and false testimony experts that the lawyers could cross-examine in upcoming trials. During my 
                internship, I also got to watch part of a trial and heard from a guest speaker who discussed his organization's 
                goal of halving the population in correctional facilities by 2030. This internship helped give me insight into the 
                value of consulting with individuals in other fields and the importance of strong client connections in a workplace.

            <h3>Uruguayan Consulate</h3>
            <p>Summer Intern</p>
            <p>July 2015 - August 2015</p>
            <p>The Uruguayan Consulate aims to help and connect the New York Uruguayan community. Their services are twofold: they 
                help individuals who recently emigrated to the United States obtain higher education and finding work opportunities, 
                and also connect them with New York residents through cultural events and programs. During the weeks that I worked 
                there, I helped with the consulate’s outreach and finances. I researched information about institutions with Latin 
                American Studies Department and Uruguayan events in New York. By doing this, I aimed to identify universities to 
                that these might be interested in studying at and help the consulate plan future events by identifying potential 
                collaboration partners. I also reviewed the consulate’s expenses to ensure that costs of travel and planning were 
                documented accurately and thoroughly. Through this work I was able to learn about the multitude of different services 
                that can facilitate these transitions and became interested in learning more how different fields such as the financial 
                and tech industries can support them.</p>
